## 🏗️ Architecture

The system combines deep learning and a user-friendly frontend for seamless recommendations:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit app (`main.py`) with a colorful UI, dropdowns, search, and manual input options, plus confidence score visualizations.
- **Model**: Bidirectional LSTM (`rnn_recommender_optimized.h5`) with:
  - **Embedding Layers**: 50-dimensional embeddings for items (16,435 vocab) and categories (784 vocab).
  - **Concatenation**: Merges item and category embeddings.
  - **Bidirectional LSTM**: 32 units with dropout (0.5) for robust sequence modeling.
  - **Dense Layer**: Softmax output for item probabilities.
- **Data Processing**: Uses `item_tokenizer` and `category_tokenizer` for tokenization, with `pad_sequences` for fixed-length inputs (max 28).
- **Artifacts**: Preprocessed data (`final_dataset.pkl`) and tokenizers stored in `artifacts` for efficient loading.
- **Dataset**: Retailrocket’s `events.csv`, `item_properties_part*.csv`, and `category_tree.csv` for user interactions and metadata.

## 📊 Model Performance

| **Model Variant** | **Precision@5** | **Recall@5** | **Why This Result?** |
|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Basic LSTM**    | 0.8462          | 0.8462       | Captures sequential patterns but struggles with long-term dependencies. |
| **Bidirectional LSTM** | **0.8535** | **0.8535** | Captures both forward and backward dependencies, improving context and accuracy. |

The **Bidirectional LSTM** excels due to its ability to learn from both past and future interactions in a sequence, making it ideal for e-commerce recommendation tasks.

## ⚠️ Things to Know

- **Valid Inputs** ✅: Use visitor IDs from the sampled list (3–28 interactions) or valid item IDs from the dataset.
- **Sequence Length** 📏: Sequences are padded to 28 items for consistency.
- **Confidence Scores** 📊: Normalized for display; raw scores are low due to the large item vocabulary (16,435).
- **Dataset Dependency** 🗄️: Requires Retailrocket dataset files for preprocessing and training.
- **Performance** ⚡: Caching ensures fast loading, but initial model loading may take a moment.
